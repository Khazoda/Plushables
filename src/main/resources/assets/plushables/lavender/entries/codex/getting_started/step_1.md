Before you can begin crafting any plushables you will need some specific resources.


The first is copper, which can be obtained by smelting raw copper mined from below ground.

A plushable builder is crafted with 4 copper ingots, red and yellow dye, 2 redstone dust and a loom.


This block is used to create every single plushable.

Once you've crafted one, every plushable recipe will be unlocked in this codex.
