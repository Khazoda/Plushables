# Getting Started 📖

- Open the Plushable Codex to view the recipe for a Plushable Builder, a block that is used to craft every plushable.
- Once you've crafted the builder, check your codex again for every plush's recipe.
- Every plushable needs either a Heart of Gold or a Powered Heart of Gold. Both recipes can be found in your codex.
